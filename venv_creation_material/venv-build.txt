Ah, You are not creating the build in a separate virtual environment.

Create a virtual environment just for build purpose and install the packages you need in this environment.

in your cmd execute these to create a virtual enviornment

python -m venv build_env

cd build_env

C:\build_env\Scripts\Activate

you will see this >>(build_env) C:\build_env

Install all the packages you need for your script, start with pyinstaller

pip install pyinstaller
or give a txt file (pip install -r requirements.txt)

Once you are all installed, build the exe as before. The exe built using the virtual environment will be faster and smaller in size!! For more details check https://python-forum.io/Thread-pyinstaller-exe-size
